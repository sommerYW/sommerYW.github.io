Funny that I used to care so much.
Funny that I do not care anymore yet whenever I am bored I go back checking that page.
Funny that I always assume this and that while they are simply not.
Funny that I constantly feel jeg er ok n√• while there are always something ambushing me waiting for that ok moment to bloody hit me.
Funny that I do not feel hurt anymore. I just stare, in a daze, numbness climbs up from my toes. Suddenly feel like laughing, because it is funny, so very very funny.
