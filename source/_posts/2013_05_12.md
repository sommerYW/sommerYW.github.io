`Mad men`

`scene 1`
- This is the one. 1962 Coupe de Ville. Does everything but make breakfast. What are you in now?
- I had a Dodge.
- Those are wonderful if you want to get somewhere. This is for when you've already arrived.
- Is that right?
- Of course, someone like you, you don't need to see yourself in a Cadillac, you're wakling about in one everyday. How'd you like your car to look like that? Look at you. I bet you'd be as comfortable in one of these as you would in your own skin.

`scene 2`
- You know what helps? Splash cold water on your face and go outside. You'll notice things are right where you left them.

`scene 3`
- If I don't go into that office everyday, who am I?

`scene 3`

- It's not easy for anyone, Pete.
