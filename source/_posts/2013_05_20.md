Some things in life are bad,
They can really make you mad,
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle.
And this'll help things turn out for the best.
And....
Always look on the bright side of life, (whistle)
Always look on the light side of life, (whistle)
If life seems jolly rotten,
There's something you've forgotten,
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Don't be silly chumps.
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing.
And...
Always look on the bright side of life. (whistle)
Come on...
Always look on the right side of life...
For life is quite absurd,
And death's the final word,
You must always face the curtain with a bow.
Forget about your sin,
Give the audience a grin,
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.
So always look on the bright side of death,
Just before you draw your terminal breath,
Life's a piece of shit,
When you look at it,
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true.
You'll see it's all a show,
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
And always look on the bright side of life,
Always look on the right side of life,
Come on guys, cheer up.
Always look on the bright side of life.
Worse things happen at sea, you know.
Always look on the bright side of life.
What have you got to lose?
You know - you come from nothing,
you're going back to nothing,
what have you lost? Nothing!
 Always look on the bright side of life.
Nothing will come from nothing,
you know what they say?
Cheer up, you old bugger!
Come on give us a grin! 
There you are!
Always look on the bright side of life.
Hei you all, see?
Always look on the bright side of life.
Always look on the bright side of life.
Always look on the bright side of life.
Always look on the bright side of life.

 一转眼四天的国庆假又还剩半天了。这四天还算充实吧，至少每天都有意想不到的事情发生。。。
- Day 1， May 17th, 出去看游行，跟Lyubov及其男友一起。俩人都很nice，那个老我们很多的男友很健谈很开朗。中午吃了shrimps，好新鲜，也不是很贵，回头可以自己去独自享受。要下手吃，吃了1 litre。。。很过瘾。游行很好玩，各种cosplay，气氛很热闹，拍了好些照片
- Day 2,  自己出去溜达，遇见三个有色人种，突尼斯还有苏丹的，其中俩话不多，打了招呼就要走了，其中一个帅一点的就一直跟着我，不知道目的是想谈生意还是泡妞，英语说得比我好，强跟着要号码，要约have a drink，假装没带手机结果也还是被要了号码，后来那人发来短信错别字一大堆，估计是没什么文化。想想还挺后怕的，自己一个人瞎溜达终归要注意下，遇到不明来路的人应该假装英语不好赶紧走开
- Day 3, 本来约了一个微博上认识的跟着老公在挪威做餐馆生意的年轻香港mm下午聊聊天晒晒太阳，临时收到Andy的邀请去hiking到办公室，于是我很重色轻友地推掉了与陌生mm的约会。。。Andy对我一直很照顾，很愉快的沿着fjord往办公室方向hiking了两个多小时，天气太好了，阳光海滩真是。。。美景绝了。以后应该少谈politics，一方面我也不真懂，另一方面容易产生分歧。。。并且我应该多看书，多增长见识，不然谈话中显得自己很无知。。。。
- Day 4, 一会儿又打算自己出去溜达。这两天来例假，正好放假不耽误上班，时间挺好的：）

加油，日子还挺好的，要珍惜。不要总在没意义的事情上浪费时间了。
