Oasis是支来自英国曼彻斯特的乐队 
Stop crying your heart out 这首歌据说原本是写给世界杯落败的英格兰队，但是很多人 喜欢上它应该是电影《蝴蝶效应》butterfly effect 的功劳，就是影片最后男、女主角擦 身而过的配乐。

Hold on 
Hold on 
Don't be scared 
You'll never change what's been and gone 
May your smile 
May your smile 
Shine on 
Shine on 
Don't be scared 
Your destiny will keep you on 

Cos all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Get on 
Get on 
Come on 
Come on 
Why you scared? 
I'm not scared 
You'll never change what's been and gone 

Cos all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Cos all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Where all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Stop crying your heart out 
Hold on 
Hold on 
Don't be scared 
You'll never change what's been and gone 
May your smile 
May your smile 
Shine on 
Shine on 
Don't be scared 
Your destiny will keep you on 

Cos all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Get on 
Get on 
Come on 
Come on 
Why you scared? 
I'm not scared 
You'll never change what's been and gone 

Cos all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Cos all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Where all of the stars 
They're fading away 
Just try not to worry 
You'll see them some day 
Take what you need 
and be on your way 
and stop crying your heart out 

Stop crying your heart out
