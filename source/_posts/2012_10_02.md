Never make an enemy by accident.
If you'll excuse me.
Good men are not like buses, there won't be another one along in ten minutes' time.
I would never be happy with anyone else as long as you walk the earth.
Never mistake a wish for a certainty.
Sometimes I feel like a creature in the wilds whose natural habitat is gradually being destroyed.
Some animals adapt to new surroundings. It seems a better choice than extinction.
I don't think it is a choice. I think it's what's in you.

——Downton Abbey
