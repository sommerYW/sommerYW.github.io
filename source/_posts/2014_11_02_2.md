Just got the news that something big is going to happen around me and I'm not gonna like it. This is upsetting.

We talked for a long time, but it only made me sadder. I think I should respect his decision, after all this is his attempt to be not unhappy. I wish I could do something someday to my own life also.

I've been selfish here, all I've been thinking is how this should affect me. I wish things could've been different, but too late now.

This is life. Two and a half years, I become pessimistic.
