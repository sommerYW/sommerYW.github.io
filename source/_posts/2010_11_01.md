The passed a few days I'm kinda busy. I finished the ppt for the class presentation, I started to write a paper on the NS damping problem(with a sorry result), but I failed to get up early although I slept early.
I cooked yesterday and today, feels good.
Life's becoming better.

The only thing that I have to worry about is to write an eligible paper before I graduate.
