I want you to know one thing
You know how this is:
If I look at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window
lf I touch near the fire, the impalpable ash,
or the wrinkled body of the log
Evervthing carrie's me to you
As if everything that exists
Aromas, light, medals,
Or little boats that sail toward
those isles of yours that wait for me

Well, now, 
If little by little
You stop loving me
I shall stop loving you
Little by little.
If suddenly you forget me
Do not look for me
For I shall already have forgotten you
If you think it long and mad
the wind of banners
that passes through my life
And you decide to leave me
at the shore of the heart where I have roots
Remember, that on that day, at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
And my roots will set off
to seek another land

But, if each day, each hour,
You feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness
If each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me
Ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten
My love feeds on your love, beloved,
And as long as you live
it will be in your arms 
without leaving mine.
